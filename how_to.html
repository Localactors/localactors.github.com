                  Who can publish a project?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Anybody can publish a project. You can be a registered NGO
                  (non-governmental organisation), other organisation or a single
                  local actor taking on a project. As a PUBLISHER you register yourself
                  and prepare your project. We will give you all our support in doing that.
                  When you are ready, you publish your project and launch your pledge for support.
                </p>

                  How does it work with money?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Every project publisher sets their project's funding goal
                  (support needed to get the project going) and deadline. If
                  SUPPORTERS like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen.
                  If the project succeeds in reaching its minimum funding goal (typically less
                  then 100% when scalability of needs apply; we help to identify it depending on the
                  type of a project), all supporters' credit cards are charged by the set deadline. If the
                  project falls shorter than that, no one is charged.
                  If a project is successfully funded, LocalActors.org applies a 4%
                  fee to the funds collected.

                  What is my guarantee?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  There is a high degree of transparency in publishing the project and feedback
                  on progress. At the same time all community can post their comments and references
                  in the visitors' book of each project. Your guarantee is the community.
                  Good cause projects can start small and grow. We recommend taking all projects step
                  by step and phasing the funding needed. We give each project dedicated support in
                  planning and monitoring. Your guarantee is the direct link between the supporter and the project.

                <p>
                  We support local action and we are willing to publish good cause - non-for-profit - projects
                  to help them get off the ground. Let it be a school coach trip, a new dwell in a village or a
                  new service to help local community. You can submit any projects in line with our vision and in
                  need of  little support in financing, knowledge or materials to get things going.

                <p>
                  If you have a project, through LocalActors.org you can address small donors directly and world-wide
                  to get fundings or other forms of support. Few of such websites exist, but none is focusing on local
                  non-for-profit projects while giving a chance to wide range of set-ups. LocalActors.org puts
                  you in contact with a large pool of passionate supporters and helps you market your idea.

                  When will the service be available?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Currently LocalActors.org founding team and supporters are gathering first projects and getting in
                  touch with a kick-off community of users. During the early spring a beta-test with self-registration
                  of projects on the website will be held and in Spring will be going live! In the meanwhile you can
                  already submit a project. LocalActors.org will process it, share it with different supporters and
                  your project will be among the first being published.

                <p>
                  If you want to support a particular local project, you can choose to do so either financially, with
                  human resources or your skills.

                <p>
                  We start as a small group of those not happy with the options opened for small donors - little
                  transparency, no feedback and no visibility of what my contribution has done. As a supporter to
                  the local action we will make sure you will have all of that, letting you know where exactly the
                  support goes and which specific benefits it brings.

                What is your goal? What do you want to achieve and when? How much it
                will costs and what other support you may need (perhaps, some materials, teachers etc.)?
                Keep it simple, keep it phased. Plan for a year and say what you achieve
                in each quarter. Project of 500 EUR will be easier to fund than a project
                of 2000 EUR. Think through what you need most.

                when is the trip expected to take place and calculate the price of
                the trip (coach with the driver or also anything else?)
