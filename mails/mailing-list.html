                  Dear *|LNAME|*!,<br />

                </h1>
                <p class='subtitle'>
                  As announced we are launching a website to create a direct link between those who run projects and those who want to support them.
                </p>
                <p class='description'>
                  Few of such websites exist, but none is focusing on local non-for-profit projects world-wide while giving a chance to wide range of set-ups.

                  WITH ECONOMIC RECESSION ALL SMALL AND LOCALLY TARGETED PROJECTS ARE IN DANGER:

                <p class='description'>
                  yet there is a lot of will to keep the local action running! If you have a project, through LocalActors.org you can address small donors directly and world-wide.
                  If you want to support a particular local project, you can choose to do so either financially, with human resources or your skills.

                  At the same time we want to know what happened next; were the animals saved,
                  was the school build? To join the local action, we all want to know where exactly the support goes and which specific benefits it brings.
